# Popular-Movies-Stage-2

for the api key  you need to make a key.xml file in
app/src/main/res/values/key.xml

and then make a string resources put a api key in string name api_key

This is a project that I make for Udacity. In this app user can see what movie is popular movie right now. It get data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ by Volley.  User can chose movie and see more detail of it.



```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key">[your api key]</string>
</resources>
```
